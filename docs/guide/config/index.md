# Clash Core configuration reference

Use this reference whenever you need to inspect mihomo YAML. A first
configuration does not need to begin with 185 fields: start with the
[best-practice template](/guide/config/best-practice), then return to the exact
field when a specific need appears.

::: tip Keep the configuration understandable
A trusted configuration that contains only what you need is easier to verify
and less likely to produce surprising behavior after an update.
:::

## EasyTier on macOS

[EasyTier](./outbound/easytier) adds a virtual-network outbound to the macOS SDK.
The protocol directory now lists **24 proxy and network outbound types**.
iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS retain 23 implementations; EasyTier nodes on those platforms
are REJECT placeholders that refuse connections. See the
[protocol list](/guide/protocols) and [Apple platform differences](./apple-platforms).
